# foleon-challenge

## Objective
We want to have an Application where we can search for photos using Flickr API

## Start
The project can start by only running `npm start`

## Decisiones made
The main decision that I faced was to not use any boilerplate, so I decided to go `React` as a main library, `Redux` as a state manager, `Redux-observables`, and `webpack` for the bundling of the files.

### Architecture
The decision of using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) was made due the simpleness that provides for the managment of the state. To take full advantage of this challenge I decided to implement [Redux-observables](https://redux-observable.js.org/) to expand my knowledge.

To make the debugging and follow trough of the application I used [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger) because, in my opinion, it gives you one of the best step by step of what is going on with the app.
